# Part 1

Do not use Tweakers and All-in-One Shit e.g AdvancedSystem Care etc etc.
Nor use these fishy Regedits from Minecraft Youtubers. If you did i advise you do a clean Install of Windows

To start now we will Tweaky Tweak Windows a bit.
You can skip the Part 1 if you want because it involves getting a better Windows Version and installing this Version.
If your willing to upgrade your Windows without loosing Data then proceed :3

What you wanna do first is open [this](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/CHEF-KOCH/7ab8229825cf6912d1a6db3a0a4f39c1/raw/ecad7acb99808d894c784b904174721fb473c9ec/esd.txt) List and scroll down to x64.
When your at x64 look for your Language code at the end, like for me, i come from Germany so i take x64fre_de-de_ if i want german language.
If you want english language ill provide a quick link for you [here](http://b1.download.windowsupdate.com/d/upgr/2020/02/19041.84.200218-1143.vb_release_svc_refresh_clientbusiness_vol_x64fre_en-gb_094ecffbbf0c70b2a9aa6038432e3b42e4f1383d.esd).

When you finished downloading it go to your C Drive and in the Folder ESD and paste the downloaded file in there.
What you wanna grab next is [wimlib-decrypter](https://github.com/abbodi1406/WHD/raw/master/scripts/esd-decrypter-wimlib-53.7z)
Unzip it in the ESD Folder and drag the .esd file you downloaded onto the decrypt.bat. A window will pop up looking like this
